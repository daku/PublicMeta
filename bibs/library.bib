@article{Dostie2010a,
abstract = {The "Chromosome Conformation Capture" (3C) and 3C-related technologies are used to measure physical contacts between DNA segments at high resolution in vivo. 3C studies indicate that genomes are likely organized into dynamic networks of physical contacts between genes and regulatory DNA elements. These interactions are mediated by proteins and are important for the regulation of genes. For these reasons, mapping physical connectivity networks with 3C-related approaches will be essential to fully understand how genes are regulated. The 3C-Carbon Copy (5C) technology can be used to measure chromatin contacts genome-scale within (cis) or between (trans) chromosomes. Although unquestionably powerful, this approach can be challenging to implement without proper understanding and application of publicly available bioinformatics tools. This chapter explains how 5C studies are performed and describes stepwise how to use currently available bioinformatics tools for experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation.},

abstract = {The increasing integration of patient-specific genomic data into clinical practice and research raises serious privacy concerns. Various systems have been proposed that protect privacy by removing or encrypting explicitly identifying information, such as name or social security number, into pseudonyms. Though these systems claim to protect identity from being disclosed, they lack formal proofs. In this paper, we study the erosion of privacy when genomic data, either pseudonymous or data believed to be anonymous, are released into a distributed healthcare environment. Several algorithms are introduced, collectively called RE-Identification of Data In Trails (REIDIT), which link genomic data to named individuals in publicly available records by leveraging unique features in patient-location visit patterns. Algorithmic proofs of re-identification are developed and we demonstrate, with experiments on real-world data, that susceptibility to re-identification is neither trivial nor the result of bizarre isolated occurrences. We propose that such techniques can be applied as system tests of privacy protection capabilities.},

abstract = {Information about an individual's place and date of birth can be exploited to predict his or her Social Security number (SSN). Using only publicly available information, we observed a correlation between individuals' SSNs and their birth data and found that for younger cohorts the correlation allows statistical inference of private SSNs. The inferences are made possible by the public availability of the Social Security Administration's Death Master File and the widespread accessibility of personal information from multiple sources, such as data brokers or profiles on social networking sites. Our results highlight the unexpected privacy consequences of the complex interactions among multiple data sources in modern information economies and quantify privacy risks associated with information revelation in public forums.},

@article{Malin2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Health care organizations must preserve a patient's anonymity when disclosing personal data. Traditionally, patient identity has been protected by stripping identifiers from sensitive data such as DNA. However, simple automated methods can re-identify patient data using public information. In this paper, we present a solution to prevent a threat to patient anonymity that arises when multiple health care organizations disclose data. In this setting, a patient's location visit pattern, or "trail", can re-identify seemingly anonymous DNA to patient identity. This threat exists because health care organizations (1) cannot prevent the disclosure of certain types of patient information and (2) do not know how to systematically avoid trail re-identification. In this paper, we develop and evaluate computational methods that health care organizations can apply to disclose patient-specific DNA records that are impregnable to trail re-identification. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To prevent trail re-identification, we introduce a formal model called k-unlinkability, which enables health care administrators to specify different degrees of patient anonymity. Specifically, k-unlinkability is satisfied when the trail of each DNA record is linkable to no less than k identified records. We present several algorithms that enable health care organizations to coordinate their data disclosure, so that they can determine which DNA records can be shared without violating k-unlinkability. We evaluate the algorithms with the trails of patient populations derived from publicly available hospital discharge databases. Algorithm efficacy is evaluated using metrics based on real world applications, including the number of suppressed records and the number of organizations that disclose records. RESULTS: Our experiments indicate that it is unnecessary to suppress all patient records that initially violate k-unlinkability. Rather, only portions of the trails need to be suppressed. For example, if each hospital discloses 100\% of its data on patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, then 48\% of the DNA records are 5-unlinkable. A na\"{\i}ve solution would suppress the 52\% of the DNA records that violate 5-unlinkability. However, by applying our protection algorithms, the hospitals can disclose 95\% of the DNA records, all of which are 5-unlinkable. Similar findings hold for all populations studied. CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that patient anonymity can be formally protected in shared databases. Our findings illustrate that significant quantities of patient-specific data can be disclosed with provable protection from trail re-identification. The configurability of our methods allows health care administrators to quantify the effects of different levels of privacy protection and formulate policy accordingly.},
